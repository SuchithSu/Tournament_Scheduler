# Tournament_Scheduler
Our project address the issue of scheduling a tournament of varying sizes and styles. Depending on the number of teams, which game playing method is being used, and the time frame of the tournament, this problem can take many different forms. Our model takes into account the cost of travel and aims to minimize the total cost of travel for all teams involved to create our optimal tournament schedule.
